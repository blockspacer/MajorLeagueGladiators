After cloning, locate your local starter content (Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/ 4.14/Samples/MobileStarterContent/Content/MobileStarterContent) and copy it to your working copy (MVRCFPS/Prototype/Content).

Whenever you pull something new from the Repo, you have to clean the local repo afterwards. To do this just execute "MVRCFPS\Prototype\clean.bat". You have to do this everytime you pull something.
